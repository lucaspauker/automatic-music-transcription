# Automatic Music Transcription

The goal of this project is to automatically transcribe an audio file into musical notation. This task is called automatic music transcription, which is a topic that has been researched since the 1970s. Automatic music transcription is a challenging task that consists of many subtasks, such as pitch estimation, note onset detection, beat tracking, and score typesetting. Automatic music transcription is useful for music education, music creation, music production, and music analysis. Many signal processing techniques as well as more recently machine learning techniques have been used to tackle this problem.

I am personally interested in this project because I like listening to and playing music. In my experience, music transcription is a long and arduous process, so I was curious to see if it would be possible to accurately automate. This notebook will be structured in a way that incrementally introduces concepts to get to the finished final product.
